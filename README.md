Welcome to our Minesweeper!

We were two on this project, Joshua Siedel and Natasha Landry.
Our game contains several levels of Minesweeper : Easy, Medium, Hard and Hardcore with about 20% bombs in it. We have the best score of every person who plays the game, so don't hesitate to give it a try!

HOW DOES IT WORK?\
You can choose the difficulty in the menu section and after your choice you enter the game. The first left click will start the timer and initialise the game. Right click is to flag a case. You can also double right click to place an unknown flag if you're not sure about the mine underneath.
When you flag a location, you have the option to double left click on a numbered case, which will reveal all the cases around it, to speed up your guessing.
F1 is for displaying the FPS
F12 is for leaving the game

THE CODE : \
To install Fungraphics, right click on the file fungraphics.jar then "add a library" (on intelliJ)
We have several files in this project.
The main file is MineSweeperConsole and MineSweeperFungraphics, for starting the game in the console and in a window.
The window version is obviously more complex than the console version. It changes the window with the gamestate file (used in MinesweeperFungraphics). This allows you to switch to the game, menu or credit file. In several files we use different classes (Animation, Audio, Blast and Case) to make the game work.

Here is some view of our game!
