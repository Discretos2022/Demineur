Welcome to our Minesweeper!

We were two on this project, Joshua Siedel and Natasha Landry. 
Our Game contains several level of Minesweeper : Easy, Medium, Hard and Hardcore with around 20% bombs in there. We have best score of each person who play the game, so, don't hesitate to try it on!

HOW THIS IS WORKING?
You can choose the difficulty in the menu part, and after your choice you enter the game. First left click and you begin the timer and the game is initialized. Right click is for flag a case. You can also double right click to put an unknown flag, if you're not sure about the mine under.
If you flag a place, you have the possibility to double left click on a numbered case, that will discover all the case around, to be faster in your guess.
f1 is for display the FPS
F12 is for quit the game

THE CODE :
We have several files in this project.
The main file is MineSweeperConsole and MineSweeperFungraphics, for launching the game the console and in a window. 
The window version is more complex than in console, obviously. It changes the window with the gamestate file.
